name: CI workflow template
# we need separate CI workflow template to achieve that a CI
# for each of PRs cancellable and one for default branch should run on every commits
# because the runner will use `concurrency.group` in the callee worfklow which is
# configured as cancellable if we don't set `concurrency.group` to caller workflow.
